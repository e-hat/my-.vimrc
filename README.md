# Instructions for future me
This is for vim8.
* Remember to install `vim-plug`. You can get that [here](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). 
* Then run `:PlugInstall`.
* Run `:CocConfig` and copypaste the file in this repo there and run `:CocInstall` or something like that.
* You probably have to `stack install` some things from [here](http://marco-lopes.com/articles/Vim-and-Haskell-in-2019/) if you're doing Haskell dev.
